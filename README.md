This repository serves as a template for setting up a development environment to run C++ code inside Docker containers using Makefiles. Whether you're working on a personal project or a team-based endeavor,
this template streamlines the process of containerizing your C++ applications, making them portable and easy to manage across different environments.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Docker: Install Docker according to the instructions for your operating system from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
- Git: Install Git if you haven't already from [Git's official website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- Make:

  - **Linux:** If you're on a Linux system, Make might already be installed. If not, you can install it using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can install Make with the following command:

    ```sh
    sudo apt-get install make
    ```

  - **Windows:** For Windows users, Make is not typically installed by default. You can install it using MinGW, which provides a Unix-like environment on Windows along with a collection of GNU utilities.
  Follow these steps to install Make on Windows using MinGW:
    1. Download and install MinGW from [MinGW's official website](http://www.mingw.org/).
    2. During installation, make sure to select the option to install the "MSYS Basic System" component, which includes Make.
    3. After installation, add the MinGW bin directory to your system's PATH environment variable. This is typically `C:\MinGW\bin`.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with CppDockerMakeTemplate:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```Makefile
   git clone https://github.com/gvatsal60/CppDockerMakeTemplate.git
   cd CppDockerMakeTemplate
   ```

2. **Build the Docker Image:**

   ```Makefile
   make build_img
   ```

3. **Inside the Docker Container:**
   Once inside the Docker container, you'll find yourself in the `$PROJECT_NAME` directory, where the project is set up.

4. **Build the Project:**

   ```Makefile
   make build
   ```

5. **Run the Executable:**

   ```Makefile
   make run
   ```

6. **Test the Project:**

   ```Makefile
   make test
   ```

7. **Clean the Project:**

   ```Makefile
   make clean
   ```

## Customization

You can customize this template according to your project's needs. Here are some areas you might want to modify:

- **Makefile:** Adjust Make configuration, add or remove source files, libraries, or dependencies as needed.
- **Dockerfile:** Modify Dockerfile to include additional packages or tools required for your project.
- **Source Files:** Add your source files under the `src` directory.
